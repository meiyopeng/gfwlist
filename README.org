This repository contains the plain text version of GFWList.  The gfwlist.txt
file is in the gfwlist branch.

The original GFWList is base64 encoded, which is quite annoying if you want to
grep or diff the content.  So I wrote the script `migrate-gfwlist.sh` to decode
it and migrate the revision history.  I guess the GFWList project adopted base64
encoding many years ago in order to bypass the basic keyword based packet
filtering of GFW when HTTP protocol was still popular.  But since HTTPS protocol
is dominant today and no one is downloading GFWList through HTTP protocol, that
is not a problem any more.  I wonder why the GFWList maintainers still stick to
base64 encoding.
